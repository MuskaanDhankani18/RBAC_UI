# RBAC_UI
The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI is a web application for efficiently managing user roles and permissions within an organization. 
Featuring an intuitive interface built with React.js, it supports role hierarchy, granular access controls, audit trails, and customizable permissions. With search, filters, and visualizations, it simplifies permission management while enhancing security and scalability.
